# Verified progress and next actions

## Bootstrap — 27 October 2026

Scope: documentation only. The initial repository was empty. No executable model, data pipeline, training, tests, GPU experiment, dependency environment or results exist at this stage. The bootstrap commit establishes shared context and intended interfaces. Branch publishing must be verified separately by the initiating assistant.

### Person 1 next

Establish the Python environment/config, implement shared encoder plus MLM objective, and prove one synthetic optimization step with tests. Then integrate Person 2's real batch.

### Person 2 next

Prepare a tiny real tokenized batch with masks, document data/tokenizer selection and produce readable examples. Hand the batch to Person 1 before finishing the whole data pipeline. Then implement statistics and geometry tests.

### Shared open decisions

- Active Person 2's name/account and repository access.
- Exact mid-review template and guide expectations.
- Supported Python/dependency versions and tested installation commands.
- FFN width, dropout/norm settings, optimization/EMA settings and predictor details.
- Normalization formula, independent-mask/span policy and packing/truncation policy.
- Measured GPU availability/throughput, feasible token budget and artifact storage.
- Checkpoint schema, geometry definitions and probe split/tuning policy.

## Append after actual work

Copy this format, preserving earlier evidence:

- Date / author / branch / commit:
- Implemented files:
- Exact command and environment:
- Actual test/integration outcome:
- Experiment ID, config and tokens (if any):
- Durable logs/checkpoint/plot locations:
- Known failures or limitations:
- Interface changes agreed with other owner:
- Next action / owner:

Do not mark literature, dataset analysis, training or evaluation completed just because code was drafted. Historical conversation plans are not test evidence.
